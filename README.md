Automation is critical for a DevOps engineer. It can reduce time spent on a task and even the amount of errors in doing repetitive tasks, automating them, configuring servers, and managing deployments. Therefore reliability across processes and reduction of manual effort is the result. Shell Scripting will help streamline processes and manage infrastructure more efficiently. It is the art of writing scripts that run on a command line.



Scripting is widely used because of its lightweight and rapidity in executing on almost any system with a shell like Bash(Bourne Again Shell) on most Linux systems. They can easily integrate with other automation tools like Docker Jenkins etc and they are often easier to implement for simpler tasks compared to weightier programming languages



fundamentals of scripting



#! bin/bash/ tell us the type of shell to be executed



#  for comments that are ignored by the hell



echo to print in the terminal



cat tail head all work with file content



grep is used for search patterns



awk sed for text processing



curl, wget fetching data from the web



Best Practices for Writing Maintainable Scripts



- use comments for your code to explain the logic which is good for clarity, 

- Descriptive variables will improve the readability of your code and ensure the names of the variables and functions are meaningful

- organizing your code using functions

- errors can easily be handled with conditions

- run scripts with the least privilege

- Test your scripts well enough before deploying them
